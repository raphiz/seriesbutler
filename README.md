## Usage
Before using Seriesbutler you should create a new directory in which the series are managed.

```bash
mkdir series/
cd series/
```

We have to initialize the directory to make it work with Seriesbutler.

```bash
seriesbutler init
```

Next, you can add new Series using the `add` command - this should be pretty straight-forward.

```bash
seriesbutler add
```

After adding the new series successfully, you can check for new episodes to download. This might take some time - the command line output will help you understand what's going on.

```bash
seriesbutler fetch
```
