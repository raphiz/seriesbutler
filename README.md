## Installation
Seriesbutler can be installed using pip. Note that Seriesbutler only supports Python 3.4!

```
sudo pip3 install seriesbutler
```


## Usage
Why should you use seriesbutler? There are two major reasons: You want your homeserver to
grab the series for you - so that they are ready for you to watch when you want to or you just
want to use the command line - instead of clicking all the ads away.

Before using Seriesbutler you should create a new directory in which the series are managed.

```bash
mkdir series/
cd series/
```

We have to initialize the directory to make it work with Seriesbutler.

```bash
seriesbutler init
```

Next, you can add new Series using the `add` command - this should be pretty straight-forward.

```bash
seriesbutler add
```

After adding the new series successfully, you can check for new episodes to download. This might take some time - the command line output will help you understand what's going on.

```bash
seriesbutler fetch
```
